# Anomaly Detection Project 
## Overview This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a given dataset using machine learning techniques.
Anomalies are data points that deviate significantly from the majority, and detecting them is critical in applications such as fraud detection
, network security, and system monitoring. ## Dataset - The dataset used for this project contains labeled data for normal and anomalous points.
- **Features**: Numerical and categorical data points that represent system metrics or behavioral patterns. - **Labels**: - `0`: Normal - `1`:
-  Anomaly ## Objective To build a robust anomaly detection model that identifies anomalies with high precision, recall, and overall accuracy.
-   ## Project Workflow 1. **Data Loading**: - The dataset is loaded using `pandas`. - Data is split into training and testing sets. 2. **Preprocessing**:
- Normalization of features for better model performance. - Handling missing values (if any). 3. **Modeling**: - A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Isolation Forest, or Neural Networks)
  - **Precision**: Proportion of true anomalies among detected anomalies. - **Recall**: Proportion of detected anomalies among all true anomalies. - **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
 **ROC AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. ## Results The model achieved the following evaluation metrics: - **Precision**: `0.89` - **Recall**: `0.79` - **F1 Score**:
-  `0.83` - **ROC AUC**: `0.96` ## Usage ### Requirements Install the required Python libraries: ```bash pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
